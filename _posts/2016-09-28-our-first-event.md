Hello everyone,

I hope your semester is starting off well. After a fitful start, we finally have a room for a meeting this Friday, 30/9, at 17h00 in room H402.

On the agenda will be...

* ...a brief presentation by Johannes Boehm on "Things I Wish I'd Known at the Start of My Phd" (M2's: Johannes said he will be updating this, so it won't be a complete repeat for you!).
* ...a brief presentation by Yours Truly on "How to Apply for Conferences and Travel Funding".
* ...a discussion of the organizations structure, goals, and future meetings.

All students, M1, M2, and Phd are welcome to attend and participate in an open discussion on all of these topics, so don't be afraid to come!

See you Friday!

-Tyler
