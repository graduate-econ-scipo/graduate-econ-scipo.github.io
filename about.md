In the <a href="http://econ.sciences-po.fr" target="_blank">Department of Economics at Sciences Po</a>, the structure and organization is changing fast as a young department develops into its own. This website and associated organization seek to provide stability to grad students preparing for the job market and seeking to branch out into the broader academic world.

Here you can find information on events in and around Paris related to economics, job market advice from students, recent graduates, and established professors, and general guidance on everything involving graduate studies.
