Below you'll find a calendar to which you can add your upcoming event if you are a group member! To add events, you must first be a member of the group, then add the corresponding calendars (Econ Sciences Po and Social Events) to your own account, and finally you can add events as you normally would.

Be sure to select the correct calendar when adding your events!
